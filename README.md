Machine Learning Coursera Project
In this work I will analyze the data given by this assignment and by conducting a machine learning process in the training set I will estimate the exercise category in the test set. In order to do so I first describe what I see in the data (control variables and dependent variable as well as missing samples) and I filter it given the high number of missing variables and near zero variance. Moreover, I create a partition to start the machine learning process. In this partition 70 percent of the data will be categorize as the training set while the remaining will be the testing set. Once the data is ready for further process, I apply a Random Forest technique to develop an algorithm that can categorize the data into the different class category of the dependent variable. The performance of this algorithm is sound and accurate in both, the training and the testing data.
